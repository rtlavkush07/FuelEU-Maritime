🧭 Reflection — My Learning Experience

Working on the FuelEU Maritime Compliance Platform has been one of my most comprehensive and insightful projects so far.
It brought together everything I’ve learned — from backend architecture and database design to frontend development and API integration — while also teaching me how to use AI tools in a balanced and meaningful way.

Earlier, I used to jump straight into coding, but this project made me appreciate planning and structure first. Implementing the Hexagonal Architecture gave me a deeper understanding of how to separate business logic from frameworks and interfaces.
It made the whole system cleaner, more modular, and much easier to debug.

Through this process, I learned to model data using Prisma + PostgreSQL, design robust APIs in Node.js, and connect everything smoothly with a React + Tailwind CSS frontend.
Beyond the technical side, I started thinking more like an engineer — breaking down complex tasks, testing each part independently, and ensuring everything worked as a whole.

⚙️ How AI Supported My Work

Throughout the project, I used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot as supportive tools — not as replacements.
ChatGPT helped me with project planning, backend folder structuring, and initial Prisma schema design, while Copilot handled smaller repetitive tasks like generating TypeScript interfaces or JSX snippets.

These tools definitely made the process faster and helped reduce setup time.
But instead of blindly using their output, I made it a point to understand every line, debug errors, and rewrite parts that didn’t fit my logic.
That approach made me much more confident in reviewing and improving AI-generated code instead of just copying it.

🧩 Challenges and How I Solved Them

AI wasn’t always accurate, and a few issues required manual intervention. For instance:

The Prisma DATABASE_URL issue needed multiple trials before it worked correctly.

Some API routes initially failed due to incorrect import paths.

On the frontend, I had to manually handle missing or empty data when the API responses weren’t as expected.

These challenges turned out to be great learning moments.
I started using Postman for API testing, Prisma Studio for database validation, and browser console logs for debugging frontend issues — things I earlier overlooked.
As a result, my debugging and problem-solving skills improved a lot.

🚀 What I’d Improve Next Time

If I revisit this project, I’d like to:

Implement proper unit and integration testing.

Add authentication and role-based access for different users.

Try Dockerizing and deploying the entire stack.

Integrate real-world maritime emission data to make the platform more practical and research-driven.

💡 Final Thoughts

AI tools definitely made this project faster, cleaner, and more organized — but the real learning came from the parts AI couldn’t do: debugging, decision-making, and designing the actual logic.
This experience taught me that AI is most powerful when used as a collaborator, not a crutch.

I now feel more confident not only in full-stack development but also in using AI intelligently — understanding its strengths, catching its mistakes, and refining its output into something truly my own.
